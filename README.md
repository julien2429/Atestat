## C# Movie Review App (Final High School Project)

This project is a movie review application built using C#. It allows users to:

* Search for movies by title
* View existing reviews for movies
* Add their own reviews, including a rating and written comment

This application serves as a final project for a high school computer science course and demonstrates basic programming concepts like user input, data storage, and retrieval.

**Future Considerations:**

* Implement user accounts for personalized review management
* Integrate with external APIs for movie information retrieval (e.g., TMDb)
* Add features like filtering reviews by genre or rating
